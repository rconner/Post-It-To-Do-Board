# Post-It To Do Board
 Semester Project for Intro to Computer Science

This program will create a virtual Post -It ToDo Board. You will be able to type your todo on one of the squares and when you are done clear it to use again for something else. 
Ultimately I would like to dress it up some and add decorations or themes but that might have to be for the next version.
